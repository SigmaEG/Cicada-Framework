  Throughout the foreseeable future, I will be working on this framework. Initially, it's compatibility will lie within the Win32 API, allowing cross-compatibility between different Windows Operating System
  distributions of which are of x86_64 architecture of course.

  This project will be maintained solely by myself and is a project that I will be working on just for "fun." Obviously, I will be making it as usable as possible for not just myself but for anyone else that wishes
  to make use of the framework.

  <b><i>
    This Framework, so to say, is intended to be classed as a wrapper around the native APIs that run on different Operating Systems. For now, it will be a wrapper around the Win32 API until I wish to work on
    a variant for another OS.

    In it's current state, this GUI Framework is not exactly, so to speak, "usable" as it is currently under a heavy development process. If you wish to for some reason use the framework for some bizarre reason then..
    You can do so? Good luck. However, I will be committing updates every time I make them at the end of each day I work on this project. For now, it is a read-only type of project, but may be a fully-usable framework
    in the future.
